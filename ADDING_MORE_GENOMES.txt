If you want to add more genomes,
SANJUAN comes with convenient Perl scripts
helping you. A step-by-step explanation is
given below.

In this manual you find as well information
on how to add / install mapping indexes
which are ONLY necessary if you want to use
the RNAseq pre-processing routine (adapter 
removal, trimming, mapping) of SANJUAN.

0. CONTENTS / STEPS
==================
1. DECIDE FOR A SHORT NAME
2. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION (GTF FILE)
3. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES
4. OBTAIN A CHROMOSOME SIZE FILE
5. ADDING MAPPING INDEXES
6. MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING


1. DECIDE FOR A SHORT NAME
==========================
To integrate a new genome into the SANJUAN installation, you
first need to decide for a short name for the genome to be added.
This short name is later the internal key for SANJUAN to find
all necessary files and you use this key when running SANJUAN
to specify the genome.

IMPORTANT: the short name should not yet be in use. Run SANJUAN
with option -g to see already available genomes.

This short name should reflect the genome and its version
which you want to install, e.g., hg19 or mm10.

We refer to this short name in the rest 
of this document by GENOMEID.


2. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION (GTF FILE)
================================================
If available for your species, we recommend to download a
ENSEMBL transcriptome gtf annotation.

Find links to all ENSEMBL GTF files available for the 
current release here:
http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html
For previous ENSEMBL releases see:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/

TIP: If available, use the file with extension 
"chr.gtf.gz" as opposed to only ".gtf.gz" to get the
annotation only for the reference chromosomes.

Download the GTF file into the SANJUAN installation
folder db/gtfs, un-compress it if necessary, and 
rename it if necessary such that its name is

GENOMEID.gtf

IMPORTANT: the GTF file uses IDs to identify
chromosomes / scaffolds. If you plan to
install mapping indexes as well, you need to obtain
the sequences of the reference chromosomes.
The IDs of the chromosomes in the GTF file and
in the sequence files must match. For more details
and hints, read section MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING.


3. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES
=================================
Go into the bin folder of the SANJUAN 
installation and run
> perl build_annotations_from_gtf.pl ../db/gtfs/GENOMEID.gtf GENOMEID /full/path/to/SANJUAN
For example,
> perl build_annotations_from_gtf.pl ../db/gtfs/hg38.gtf hg38 /software/SANJUAN

where /software/SANJUAN contains the sub-folders
bin, lib, perllib, db, mapping_indexes.

If successful, this script populates the folder 
-> db/SANJUAN_annotation_files with
GENOMEID_Transcript_Junctions.txt
GENOMEID_Transcripts.bed
GENOMEID_TxID2Name.txt
-> and db/genomes with
GENOMEID.genome

If the last file GENOMEID.genome was not generated,
go on with OBTAIN A CHROMOSOME SIZE FILE,
otherwise you are done. See section ADDING MAPPING INDEXES
on how to compile the STAR index for the new genome.

4. OBTAIN A CHROMOSOME SIZE FILE
================================
SANJUAN expects a file in db/genomes with name
GENOMEID.genome. This file is a text file with 
two columns: chromosome and chromosome size. 
You can try to use the fetchChromSizes script
provided by UCSC and included in the SANJUAN distribution
to download the chromosome size file and move it to the 
genomes sub-folder as follows.

If the name of the downloaded file does not match
GENOMEID.genome, rename this file accordingly.

NOTE: the downloaded files from UCSC follow the chr prefix
convention for chromosomes. If you are using GTF and FASTA 
sequence files following the ENSEMBL naming convention,
edit the downloaded file and remove the chr prefix.


5. ADDING MAPPING INDEXES
=========================
If you will use SANJUAN for mapping you will need to make 
available STAR mapping indexes for the new genome as well.

Therefore, download the sequence files for the 
reference chromosomes. You can download these files from
the corresponding UCSC database (chr prefix convention).
You can view the list of all available genomes and genome 
versions from UCSC here:
ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/

Go into the folder bigZips and download the compressed FASTA file.

For example,
ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz

Alternatively, you can use ENSEMBL (no chr prefix convention).
You can find links to all available ENSEMBL genomes FASTA
files for the current release here:
http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html
For previous ENSEMBL releases see:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/

Download the genome sequences into any folder you want
and un-compress the file if necessary.

Create a directory which will contain the index inside the
SANJUAN installation inside folder mapping_indexes

mkdir /path/to/SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/GENOMEID

Finally, build the STAR genome index (STAR v>2.4.x required)
using the following command.

> STAR --runThreadN 10 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir /path/to/SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/GENOMEID --genomeFastaFiles <YOUR_DOWNLOADED_FASTA_FILE> --sjdbGTFfile /path/to/SANJUAN/db/gtfs/GENOMEID.gtf --sjdbOverhang 124 

Where the number specified for --sjdbOverhang is optimally
the length of your most commonly used reads minus 1 or the
more generic value 100 (see also STAR manual for details).

You can delete of keep the FASTA file with genomic sequences
and the STAR temporary files.

Run the following command to see if the added genome is
available for mapping as well.
> sanjuan -g

IMPORTANT: the IDs of the reference chromosomes must
be the same as those used in the GTF file (steps
2. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION (GTF FILE)
and 3. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES). For more details
and hints, read section MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING.
Please note as well that the annotation data which
comes with SANJUAN uses the "chr" prefix. Hence, we
recommend to download the reference sequences from the
UCSC resources.

IMPORTANT: the specified genomeDir has to be inside the
mapping_indexes directory of SANJUAN and its name has to match
the GENOMEID used in previous steps.

If you have already built a STAR genome index for the genome
to be added to SANJUAN, you might create symbolic links inside 
the directory
/path/to/SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/GENOMEID 
pointing to the already existing index files.


6. MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING
===============================
If you install the mapping index for a new genome as well, 
you will have to obtain the genome sequences of this species.
In this case, you need to make sure that the chromosome ids
in both, the GTF file and the FASTA files(s) match. 

ENSEMBL is using a naming convention that omits 
the "chr" prefix from chromosome ids, i.e., 1 versus chr1.
GENCODE and UCSC are using the prefix "chr", 
i.e., chr1 versus 1. 
If your genome sequences and the transcriptome 
annotation come from different resources where the
chromosome ids differ by using / or not using the "chr"
prefix, it is recommended to add the "chr" prefix where
it is missing. This is, in most cases, easier as removing
this prefix.

For adding the "chr" prefix to a GTF file, run:

> sed 's/^\([^#]\)/chr\1/' <FILE_NAME>.gtf > <FILE_NAME>.chr.added.gtf 
For example:
sed 's/^\([^#]\)/chr\1/' hg19.gtf > hg19.added.gtf 

For adding the "chr" prefix to FASTA sequences,
you might do the following.
1. in the folder where you have your FASTA file,
create a new file, put the following line into it, 
save it under the name addchr.pl

open($fh,$ARGV[0]);while(<$fh>){if(substr($_,0,1) eq ">"){print ">chr".substr($_,1);next;}print "$_";}

2. when you want to add the chr-prefix to all sequence ids in
all files with ending *.fa in this folder, run
for file in ./*.fa; do
perl addchr.pl $file > tmp_file.fa
mv tmp_file.fa $file
done
