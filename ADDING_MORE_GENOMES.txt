If you want to install / add more genomes,
SANJUAN comes with convenient Perl scripts
helping you. A step-by-step explanation is
given below.

In this manual you find as well information
on how to add / install mapping indexes
which are ONLY necessary if you want to use
the RNAseq pre-processing routine (adapter 
removal, trimming, mapping) of SANJUAN.

0. CONTENTS / STEPS
==================
1. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION IN FORM OF A GTF FILE
2. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES
3. OBTAIN A CHROMOSOME SIZE FILE
4. ADDING MAPPING INDEXES
5. MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING


1. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION IN FORM OF A GTF FILE
===========================================================

If available for your species, we recommend to download a
ENSEMBL transcriptome gtf annotation.
You may find a ENSEMBL GTF_FILE for species SPECIES and 
release RELEASE_NUMBER under:

ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/<RELEASE_NUMBER>/gtf/<SPECIES>/<GTF_FILE>.gz

For example, you might download for Homo sampiens hg38, 
release 84 the following GTF file.

> wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-84/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.chr.gtf.gz

This file needs to be un-compressed:
> gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.chr.gtf.gz


Find links to all ENSEMBL GTF files available for the 
current release here:
http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html
For previous ENSEMBL releases see:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/

TIP: If available, use the file with extension 
"chr.gtf.gz" as opposed to only ".gtf.gz" to get the
annotation only for the reference chromosomes.

IMPORTANT: the GTF file uses IDs to identify
chomosomes / scaffolds. If you plan to
install mapping indexes as well, you need to obtain
the sequences of the reference chromosomes.
The IDs of the chromosomes in the GTF file and
in the sequence files must match. For more details
and hints, read section MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING.

2. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES
=================================

From the GTF file, build the SANJUAN annotation files with
help of the script build_annotations_from_gtf.pl contained
in the bin folder of the SANJUAN installation. Here you
have to decide under which short name 
(prefix_for_output_files) this genome should be available 
from within SANJAUN. Whenever you want to run SANJUAN on 
data of this genome / species, you will have to specify 
it by this short name.

> perl build_annotations_from_gtf.pl gtf_file prefix_for_output_files
For example,
> perl build_annotations_from_gtf.pl Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.chr.added.gtf hg38

Move the generated files to the folder 
SANJUAN_annotation_files which is inside the db folder
of the SANJUAN installation.
For example,
> mv hg38_T* /path/to/SANJUAN/installation/db/SANJUAN_annotation_files

IMPORTANT: the short name should not yet be in use. Run SANJUAN
with option -g to see already available species / genomes.


3. OBTAIN A CHROMOSOME SIZE FILE
================================
This is a text file with two columns: chromosome 
and chromosome size. Use the fetchChromSizes script
provided by UCSC and included in the SANJUAN distribution
to download the chromosome size file and move it to the 
genomes subfolder as follows.
> /path/to/SANJUAN/installation/bin/fetchChromSizes hg38 > /path/to/SANJUAN/installation/db/genomes/hg38.genome

IMPORTANT: here hg38 is the UCSC identifier for the 
genome of interest. You have to determine this identifier
for your genome of interest first and use it instead of hg38.


NOTE: the downloaded files from UCSC follow the chr prefix
convention for chromosomes. If you are using GTF and FASTA 
sequence files following the ENSEMBL naming convention,
edit the downloaded file and remove the chr prefix.
The file name, here as example hg38.genome, needs
to follow the naming convention: 

prefix_for_output_files.genome

where prefix_for_output_files was chosen in step 2.


4. ADDING MAPPING INDEXES
=========================
If you are use SANJUAN for mapping you will need to 
make available to SANJUAN mapping indexes as well.

Therefore, download the sequence files for the 
reference chromosomes. You can download these files from
the corresponding UCSC database (chr prefix convention):

ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/GENOME_VERSION/bigZips/fasta_file.gz
For example, for hg38 run
> wget ftp://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz

Alternatively, you can use ENSEMBL (no chr prefix convention):
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/RELEASE_NUMBER/fasta/SPECIES/dna/fasta_file.gz
For example, for hg38 run
> wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-84/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz

Next, un-compress these files.
For example,
> gunzip hg38.fa.gz 

IMPORTANT: the IDs of the reference chromosomes must
be the same as those used in the GTF file (steps
1. OBTAIN A TRANSCRIPTOME DESCRIPTION IN FORM OF A GTF FILE 
and 2. BUILD SANJUAN ANNOTATION FILES). For more details
and hints, read section MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING.
Please note as well that the annotation data which
comes with SANJUAN uses the "chr" prefix. Hence, we
recommend to download the reference sequences from the
UCSC resources.

Finally, build the STAR genome index for the file using the
STAR genome generatate command (STAR v>2.4.x required). eg.:
> STAR --runThreadN 64 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/hg38/ --genomeFastaFiles hg38.fa --sjdbGTFfile SANJUAN/db/gtfs/hg38.gtf --sjdbOverhang 124 
Where the number specified for --sjdbOverhang is optimally
the length of your most commonly used reads minus 1 or the
more generic value 100 (see also STAR manual for details).

Notice that the specified genomeDir HAS to be inside the
mapping_indexes directory of SANJUAN and its name HAS to match
the prefix_for_output_files used in previous steps (e.g here hg19)

If you have already built STAR genome indices for your genome(s)
of interest you can move them to the appropriate SANJUAN folder
to use them from within SANJUAN. e.g:
> mkdir SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/hg38/
> mv MY_STAR_INDICES/Human_hg38/* SANJUAN/mapping_indexes/hg38/

versions from UCSC here:

You can find links to all available ENSEMBL genomes FASTA
files for the current release here:

For previous ENSEMBL releases see:
ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/


5. MAKE CHROMOSOME IDS MATCHING
===============================
Chromosome IDs in the GTF file and genome 
sequence files have to match. If you install the
mapping indexes for your species as well, you will
have to obtain the genome sequences of this species.
In this case, you need to make sure that the chromosome
ids in both, the GTF file and the FASTA files(s) 
match. 
ENSEMBL is using a naming convention that omits 
the "chr" prefix from chromosome ids, i.e., 1 versus chr1.
GENCODE and UCSC are using the prefix "chr", 
i.e., chr1 versus 1. 
If your genome sequences and the transcriptome 
annotation come from different resources where the
chromosome ids differ by using / or not using the "chr"
prefix, it is recommended to add the "chr" prefix where
it is missing. This is, in most cases, easier as removing
this prefix where it is too much.

For adding the "chr" prefix to a GTF file, run:

> sed 's/^\([^#]\)/chr\1/' <FILE_NAME>.gtf > <FILE_NAME>.chr.added.gtf 
For example:
sed 's/^\([^#]\)/chr\1/' Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.chr.gtf > Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.84.chr.added.gtf 

For adding the "chr" prefix to FASTA sequences,
you might do the following.
1. in the folder where you have your FASTA sequences, 
create a new file, put the following line into it, 
save it under the name addchr.pl

open($fh,$ARGV[0]);while(<$fh>){if(substr($_,0,1) eq ">"){print ">chr".substr($_,1);next;}print "$_";}

2. in this folder when you want to change all files with ending *.fa, run
for file in ./*.fa; do
perl addchr.pl $file > tmp_file.fa
mv tmp_file.fa $file
done
